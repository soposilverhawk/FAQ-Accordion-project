## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This project helped me better understand how to manipulate DOM elements with javascript to create interactive components. Apart from that, I learned how to define custom-properties in css

### Continued development

The project outlined my lacking understanding of CSS grid which I would like to focus on and better for the future. Apart from that I would like to keep using newly learned CSS custom-properties

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me in equally positioning the content within each FAQ. I'm more used to using flexbox instead of grid layout, so it was a good learning experience.
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This explained how to define and use custom-properties in css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
